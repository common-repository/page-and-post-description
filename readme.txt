	View Description for each Page and Post.

== Description ==
The "Page and Post Description" plugin extends the capabilities of the standard Post-List in the Admin Panel.

Posts and Pages do not have Descriptions by default, but sometimes, when a lot of time passes, it can be difficult to remember what exactly is written in a particular page. And you have to spend time opening this Post to see its contents. A small Description - like a Note, can be of great help in some situations.

It is this new "Description" Field that is added to each Post. And it can be changed both on the Edit page (in the form of a Widget), and directly in the List of Posts (Posts and Pages)

The "Description" field (for brevity in the List named "Note" to make the most of the workspace and at the same time avoid abbreviations) is highlighted on a separate line for the entire width of the List, because these Descriptions can be long and detailed. Otherwise, there is no point in them.

This Plugin gives you this opportunity.
